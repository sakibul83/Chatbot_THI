# How to Start the FastAPI Server

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your machine. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Install FastAPI and Uvicorn if you haven't done so yet:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

## Navigate to the Project Directory
1. Open your terminal.
2. Change to the directory where your `chatbot.py` file is located. For example:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/sakibul/Downloads/chatbot_project
   ```

## Check File Presence
Make sure `chatbot.py` is present in the directory by running:

```bash
ls
```

## Run the FastAPI Server
To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn chatbot:app --reload
```

Alternatively, you can run it using Python:

```bash
python -m uvicorn chatbot:app --reload
```

## Access the API Documentation
Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation by visiting:

[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

## Stopping the Server
To stop the server, press `CTRL + C` in the terminal where the server is running.

## If You Encounter Errors
If you see an error like "Could not import module 'chatbot'", ensure:
- You are in the correct directory.
- There are no naming conflicts (i.e., a folder named `chatbot` in the same directory).

You can create an empty `__init__.py` file if needed:

```bash
touch __init__.py
```

## Running with Absolute Path (if needed)
If the server fails to start with the usual command, you can specify the absolute path:

```bash
python -m uvicorn /Users/sakibul/Downloads/chatbot_project/chatbot:app --reload
```
